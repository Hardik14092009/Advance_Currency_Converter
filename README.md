This is a currency convertor made using Java 15. But unlike other currency converters, it allows you to add additional currencies without even going through the code. It's data source is a XML file. You can add currencies by butting some XML like this.

```
<conversion id="(conversion_type) eg. rupeetopound">
        <default>(value of second currency in respect to other currency) eg 99.8</default>
</conversion>
```
